[PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/) is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission to better understand how the mass and energy of the Sun’s corona become the solar wind that fills the solar system. Four suitcase-sized satellites will work together to produce images of the entire inner solar system around the clock. The image above is [PUNCH's first light](https://punch.space.swri.edu/punch_news.php?story=2025-04-17_punch_news_first-light-composite)!
