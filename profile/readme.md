# PUNCH Mission   

[PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/) is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission to better understand how the mass and energy of the Sun’s corona become the solar wind that fills the solar system. Four suitcase-sized satellites work together to produce images of the entire inner solar system around the clock.

Above is a Level 2 image. This shows the three WFIs in a mosaic. As calibration is improved, the seams and artifacts will be reduced. Level 3 products will have the F-corona and stars subtracted.
