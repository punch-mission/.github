[PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/) is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission to better understand how the mass and energy of the Sunâ€™s corona become the solar wind that fills the solar system. Four suitcase-sized satellites work together to produce images of the entire inner solar system around the clock.
